# My-Daily-Chores

## Description
This program is a simple chores list to help you stay organized throughout the day. The list is just a basic guide to make sure you get your essential duties done each and every day. 

## How to run
Download the files to a directory on your computer and open the index.html file into you web browswer. Customize the list each morning or night before, check the list throughout the day while removing items when they are completed. 

To remove an item: simply click on it. 
To add an item: type it in at the bottom and press the return or enter key on your keyboard. 

## Future Improvements
Update the styling to be more attractive. It would also be nice to have the items that were complete be sorted into another area instead of just disappear.
